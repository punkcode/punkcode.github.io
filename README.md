# Punk Code
A website for Punk Code.

Inspired by the principles of [The Lean Web](https://leanweb.dev/).

Built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) to get a pure, slimmed HTML/CSS product. No JavaScript at the moment, but will need to add it for GDPR purposes. Keeping this as JS-free as possible as it is not needed.

Website hosted on GitHub as I thought their [Sustainability Profile](https://github.blog/2021-04-22-environmental-sustainability-github/) looked good.

Videos hosted on LinkedIn for the [same reason](https://socialimpact.linkedin.com/environmental-sustainability). However, LinkedIn could do better and remove their surveillance capitalism tracking.

Designed by taking Penguin Books and making it a punk zine.

The logo is a v√•rdkase or signal fire.
